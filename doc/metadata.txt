Introduction
------------

  Yast2 sysconfig editor can edit /etc/sysconfig files. In this editor users
can change values in easy way using GUI. Yast2 sysconfig editor needs more
data (metadata) to display and edit sysconfig variables - metadata were stored
in meta_sys.config file in yast2-sysconfig package. This file contained
information about position in tree widget, allowed values, etc.

  This separation between data and metadata caused inconsistency - new variable
in sysconfig file had no metadata and removed variables still had metadata in
yast2 package. (If variable was renamed both problems occured...)

  There was also problem with maintenance of data and metadata: data were
maintained by package maintainer but metadata by yast2 sysconfig maintainer.


  It was decided to change this situation and make metadata part of
sysconfig file.



Metadata - description of variable
----------------------------------

  At first here is small example to see how metadata look. Here is
part of /etc/sysconfig/boot file with new metadata:

## Path:	System/Boot
## Description:	Boot configuration
## Type:	yesno
## Default:	no
# 
# For interactive debugging of the startup process. If set
# to "yes" the system will ask whether to confirm every
# step of the boot process.
#
PROMPT_FOR_CONFIRM="no"


  Metadata are part of variable description comment, metadata line begins with
double hash character ("##"). It contains pairs <keyword>:<value>. More values
can be specified in comma separated list, values in list which contain comma or
space character have to be quoted (e.g. "value with spaces").

  Long values can be splitted to more lines. To use multiple values use
backslash (\) as a last character on the line. (Trailing backslash and double
hash character at beginning of the next line will be removed and lines will be
concatenated.)

  Normal comment (after single hash characer) is displayed as help text,
comment after three hash characer is ignored - part of comment can be hidden
for yast2 user.

  Metadata block have to be located at beginnig of comment block. Metadata can
have any order in metadata block. (Exception is Description tag which is
related to the previous Path tag.)


Metadata keywords:

    Path - where variable will be located in tree widget, valid for all next
           variables in file - path have to be specified at least in first
           variable in file. First character of subtree name should be upper
	   case letter.
	   
	   Fillup utility adds missing variables at the end of output - if more
	   templates are merged to one sysconfig file and each template have
	   different path it is possible that variable with description comment
	   will be stored in another location in target file (this can happen
	   if variable is defined in more templates). In this case each path
	   specification should be located at unique variable or each variable
	   should have explicitly defined path.

    Description - description of path, displayed if user selects path in tree instead
	   of variable. It should contain description of whole subtree - each path
	   specification should have description. If path has more than one
	   description last found will be used.
	   
	   If more packages requires same base package then description should
	   be located only in the base package. If packages are independent
	   description should be located in separate file (located in yast2
	   sysconfig package.)

	   Desription value is related to previous Path keyword (which can be
	   located even in previous variables).
	   
    Type - type of variable. This keyword specifies data type of value, it is
           used for checking entered value.

           Supported types:

	    Type			Valid values
	    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	    string		any value
	    string(v1,v2,...)	value from list or any value
	    list(v1,v2,...)	only value from list
	    integer		integer
	    integer(min:max)	integer in specified range (one limit can be missing,
				use e.g. integer(0:) for values >= 0)
	    boolean		only "true" or "false"
	    yesno		only "yes" or "no"
	    ip			IPv4 or IPv6 adress (e.g. 10.20.0.1)
	    ip4			IPv4 adress
	    ip6			IPv6 adress
	    regexp(re)		only strings that matches regular expression re
				(POSIX Extended Regular Expression), e.g. use
				regexp(^0[0-7]*$) for octal values.
		
	    If this keyword is missing default value "string" will be used.

    Default - default value. Valid value (allowed by keyword Type) which will be
           set if user press [Default] button in yast2 module.


  All keywords are optional.


Predefined paths

  All sysconfig variables will be divided into basic categories:

Hardware - all hardware related settings (e.g. sysconfig files: sound, keyboard...)
System - basic system configuration (boot, suseconfig, cron, console, security...)
Desktop - desktop settings (kde, gnome, xdm...)
Applications - java, ispell, man...
Network - network services (apache, mail, nfs...)
Other - other settings which does not fit into classes above (This section will
    be used as fallback if no section is specified in sysconfig file - in this
    case name of subtree will be file name.)

  In path specification should be used one path from list above as first part
of path (e.g. path: Hardware/Joystick, path: System/Console). Depth of path can be
greater than two - e.g. System/Filesystem/Fam.

  Description of predefined paths and paths defined in more templates is read
from separate file, which is part of yast2 sysconfig module.
  

Missing metadata

  If variable does not have any metadata previous will be used. If previous
metadata is missing yast2 cannot offer predefined values to user. In this
case will be used "Type: string" as default metadata so user can enter any value. 

  
  Example (/etc/sysconfig/joystick):

#
# Gameport module names
# (typically "ns558" for legacy gameport support)
#
GAMEPORT_MODULE_0=""
GAMEPORT_MODULE_1=""
GAMEPORT_MODULE_2=""
GAMEPORT_MODULE_3=""


  Comment description (and metadata "Type: string") will be used for all
four variables.



Update problem
--------------

  At update old and new config files are merged by fillup utility, but old
comments are preserved (user's comments will not be deleted or changed...),
but metadata should be updated to new values - this requires some changes
in fillup utility.

  Sysconfig file must have a template - even files created by Yast, this is
required for updating metadata at package update.
